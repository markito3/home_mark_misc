From the Lab, you go south on Jefferson, right on to J. Clyde Morris 
Blvd., and left on to Warwick Blvd. (that's south on Warwick). You pass 
a 7-11 on your right (Cedar Ave.) and turn right at the next street, Elm 
Ave. There is a Crown gas station on the near right corner. You then 
turn left on to Holly Dr. Holly is both the third and fourth street on 
the left. Find a map attached.
