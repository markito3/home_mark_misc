           _w_h_o         One or a combination of two or more of the following:

                            uuuu    Modify permissions for user.
                            gggg    Modify permissions for group.
                            oooo    Modify permissions for others.
                            aaaa    Modify permissions for all users (aaaa is
                                 equivalent to uuuuggggoooo).

           _o_p          Must be specifed, and can be one of the following:

                            ++++    Add _p_e_r_m_i_s_s_i_o_n to the existing file mode
                                 bits.
                            ----    Delete _p_e_r_m_i_s_s_i_o_n from the existing file
                                 mode bits.
                            ====    Set _p_e_r_m_i_s_s_i_o_n to specified value (discard
                                 existing mode bits).

           _p_e_r_m_i_s_s_i_o_n  Any combination of the following letters:

                            rrrr    Add or delete read permission for _w_h_o.
                            wwww    Add or delete write permission for _w_h_o.
                            xxxx    Add or delete execute permission for _w_h_o.
                            ssss    Set owner or group ID for _w_h_o.  Useful only
                                 if uuuu or gggg is explicitly or implicitly
                                 present in _w_h_o.

      Absolute permissions can be set by specifing a _n_u_m_e_r_i_c__m_o_d_e, an octal
      number constructed from the logical OR of the following mode bits:

      Miscellaneous mode bits:


           +------------------ 4000  set user ID on execution (file)
           |                           or hide directory (see _c_d_f(4))
           |     +------------ 2000  set group ID on execution
           |     |     +------ 1000  sticky bit; see _c_h_m_o_d(2)

o CERNLIB
- when compiling routines use: f77 +ppu ...
  to put underscores after the symbol names. That is how they appear in the
  .a files.

o cis: must be accessed on cebafa

o colors: find list of them in /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt

o CVS
- date format is month/day/year, e. g., 2/15/1996
- -D switch refers to version at beginning of day in question, i. e.,
  at 0:00 hours.
- to make a cvs repository under $DIR/CVSROOT:

  setenv CVSROOT $DIR
  /usr/site2/gnu/cvs-1.3/cvsinit

- commits can only be done to the repository that the file was checked
  out from. $CVSROOT alone will not direct a file to a different
  repository. This is enforced in the file CVS/Repository where the path
  of the original repository is stored. If you try to commit to a
  different repository you might get a message like:

  cvs commit: failed to create lock directory in repository `/usr/site2/epics_physics/cvsroots/apple/hvca/bin': Permission denied
  cvs commit: lock failed - giving up
  cvs [commit aborted]: lock failed - giving up

  if the original repository is not visible from where you sit.
- tagging commands:

  cd hvca
  cvstag | grep release | sort | less
  ~/epics/perl/tags.pl release-2-3

- cvs 1.3 requires "mkmodules $CVSROOT/CVSROOT" to update
  administrative files.


o disks
- du: show disk usage
- bdf: show global disk usage, -l for local disks only

o documentation
- Various manuals: lrom on cebafh. Don't forget to clear the color map before
  starting.

o elm
- aliases: make entries in ~/.elm/aliases.text, execute command "elmalias"

o emacs
- Switch between windows: ^XO
- Go to another buffer: ^XB (<space> to see existing buffers)
- See list of buffers in split window: ^X^B
- Include a file: ^X^F
- Unsplit windows: ^X1
- Split windows: ^X2
- Isearch:
    <ESC> terminates string
    ^S to find next occurrence forward
    ^R to find next occurrence backward
- Go to specific line: <ESC>x
                       goto-line
                       line number
- save without exit: ^X^S
- Exit editor: ^X^C
- Abort present command: ^G
- Macro's
  ^X( ...key sequence... ^X)
  ^Xe runs macro
- key binding
  M-x local-set-key
  <key>
  <command>
    o M-x = <ESC>x
    o a popular <command> is call-last-kbd-macro
- files on remote hosts
  /username@hostname:/usual_path/filename

o enscript
  To build it:
    tar xvf enscript-1.4.0.tar
    cd enscript-1.4.0
    ./configure --prefix=/home/marki
    make
    make install

o environment variables
- setenv: set one
- unsetenv: get rid of one

o errors
- too many processes: blew user limit on number of processes. Limit is
  25 on cebafb, 50 on e and 50 on h (10/8/96). See /etc/conf/dfile,
  entry "maxuprc." (e and h show no entry for maxuprc. Is the default
  50?)

o fonts
              You
              will find the various X fonts in the /usr/lib/X11/fonts
              directory.  Note that Emacs will only accept fixed width
              fonts.  Under the X11 Release 4 font-naming conventions, any
              font with the value "m" or "c" in the eleventh field of the
              font name is a fixed width font.  Furthermore, fonts whose
              name are of the form widthxheight are generally fixed width,
              as is the font fixed.  See xlsfonts(1) for more information.

o fortran
- stdin is unit 5
- for debugging: -g -C
- for static variables -K, don't forget to do this!

NOTE  To call any of the routines or functions in this chapter, a program
      must be compiled with either the +e or +E1 option, or must contain
      the $NOSTANDARD INTRINSICS compiler directive.  Also note that
      before using the +e option, you should be aware of its side-effects
      described in Chapter 19    .

- The following code displays the current date and time to standard output:
 
     CHARACTER*9 TODAY
     CHARACTER*8 TIMESTR
        :
     CALL DATE(TODAY)
     CALL TIME(TIMESTR)
     PRINT *,TODAY,TIMESTR

- RAN returns a random (uniformly distributed) floating-point number
  between 0.0 inclusive and 1.0 exclusive using a multiplicative
  congruential random number generator.

  r = RAN(iseed)
 
  The argument iseed must be an integer (INTEGER, INTEGER*4) variable or
  array element.  RAN stores a number in iseed to be used by the next call
  to RAN. iseed should initially be set to an odd number, preferably very
  large.  Refer to the following example.
 
  Example 
 
     ISEED = 425001
     RND = RAN(ISEED)

o ftp
- for best results, use xftp and not netscape

o geant
- gotta give a "READ 4" command from stdin to get geant to start
  reading cards on unit 4.
- gustep codes:
                                 ignext inwvol istop destep
    entering volume                0      1      0    zero
    taking a step inside volume    0      0      0    non-zero
    leaving volume                 1      2      ?    non-zero
    born inside volume             0      1      0    ?
    eaten (low E, int. w/ no sec.) 0      0      2    ?   
- DRAW coordinates
  ~ origin of screen coordinates is at lower-left corner.
  ~ x_screen = f_screen*(f_draw*x_real + x_offset)
  ~ where x_screen is x coord on screen
          f_screen is the scale factor applied when 1:1 is requested (~0.7).
          f_draw is the scale factor given to the DRAW command
          x_real is the real detector coordinate
          x_offset is the offset given to the DRAW command

o gnu
- to print documentation, for example for make:
    tar xvf make-3.75.tar
    cd make-3.75
    ./configure --prefix=/scratch/marki
    make
    tex make.texinfo
    dvips -o make.ps make

o id: gives user id and group id

o LaTex
- no page numbers: \pagestyle{empty}

o links: ln -s real_file_name virtual_file_name

o ls
- -R to recursively list subdirectories

o Mail
  - If mail file is corrupt, try reading with mail or mailx.

o monitoring cpu use
- ps -e | sort -k3n ---> will show top cpu-time-used processes
- ps -fu uid --> to find user name given user id number
                 to see full command line that started process
                 to see start time of process
- ps -lu uid --> to see nice value of process
- top: use "top -u" on cebafa, h
- renice: to change priority of an existing job. "renice <pid>" works for most
  cases.

o network
- IP address database file: /site/info/IPaddress
- nslookup to find an IP address (name server look up)
- before changing or adding an ethernet device, IP address must be
  entered in the lab name tables, otherwise packets cannot be routed
  correctly(?). 

o path
- Best not to define path in .cshrc. Otherwise, if the path is changed
  for a given csh or tcsh process, then those changes cannot be exported
  to daughter processes; the definition in .cshrc will overwrite the
  changes.

o printing
- to cancel a print job, example: cancel cb113q-110
  where cb113q-110 is the job number
  to cancel all jobs try: cancel -a cb113q
- color printer: pscolor1 in computer center, postscript only(?),
                 see alias lpcolor in .cshrc
- hp printer upstairs: cl210hp
- upstairs in counting house: alch301
- Hall A counting room: cha1hp
- QMS printer in Wing A: ca109q
- duplex: qpr -d -Pcb113q <filename>
- HP in Hall B counting room: clonhp

o profiling programs
- link with -G switch (don't compile with it (and maybe you have to *not* use
  the -C switch?)).
- run the code
- look for gmon.out
- gprof excutable_name > text_file_of_profiling_info

o plant or computer service requests: on cebafb or h
  setup service
  service

o remote terminal session:

  /usr/site2/bin/xtm <hostname>

  or

  remsh clas10 /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display clasxt23:0 &

o reqs: online purchasing system. On db1:

  source .cshrc.cue_default
  source .login.cue_default
  reqs

  This procedure is sufficient, if not necessary.

- use DEC keypad, <PF4> to pop up a level.

o shells
- csh does not allow passing of arguments to a script via the source
  command, tcsh does.

o special characters (HP10, response to echo command, except for $):
  ~ tilde
  ` backward single quote
  $ dollar sign
  & ampersand
  * asterisk
  ( open parenthesis
  ) close parenthesis
  ; semi-colon
  " douuble quote
  ' single quote
  \ backslash
  | verical bar
  < less than
  > greater than
  ? question mark

o Terminal Server
  telnet to latsrv.cebaf.gov
  CLON, HALLBC
  set host/lat LAT1P4
  HALLBC

  to disconnect: <ctrl-\>

o umask
 ________________________________________________________

 EXAMPLES
    Symbolic-Mode:
      Set the umask value to produce read, write, and execute permissions
      for the file's owner and read-only permission for all others (-rwxr--
      r--) on newly created files:

           umask u=rwx,g=r,o=r

      Set the umask value to produce read, and write permissions for the
      file's owner, read-only for others users in the same group, and no
      access to others (-rw-r-----):

           umask a-rwx,u+rw,g+r

    Octal-Mode:
      Set the umask value to deny read, write, or execute permissions to

      everyone (----------):

           umask 0777

o uname: gives name of unix operating system, e. g.,
  > uname
  HP-UX

o usenet
- tin: has posting capability
- trn
- xrn

o what: gives version information in executables, e. g.,
  what /bin/cc
  /bin/cc:
          HP92453-01 A.09.77 HP C Compiler
                (CXREF  A.09.75)

o WWW
- lynx: on cebaf1
    setup lynx
    lynx

o X windows
- xwininfo     gives information on clicked-on object

o xdb
  On pg 4-77 of HP xdb manual:
  >b proc {Q; if (x<y) {p x,y};  c;}
  The Q suppresses the stupid breakpoint message ("Quiet")

o xfig: /scratchb/freyberg/xfig.3.1.4/xfig

o xterm
- fonts are set in .Xdefaults

o zipped files
- to unzip them try: zcat CURRENT.Z | tar -xf -
-   .gz gunzip (gnu)
-   .Z uncompress (unix)
-   .tgz first gunzip, then tar or: tar -zxf filename.tgz
